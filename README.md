FittsLawTest
============
This repository is for people who wish to test the quality of their pointing device (mouse, touchpad, or their own device) and to compare it with other pointing devices. 

The standard Fitt's Law test is implemented in tester.py, while the modified version which focuses on measuring the homing time it takes to switch from typing on the keys to clicking with the device is implemented in MFLT.py.

To analyze the data recorded, use dataAnalysis.py to get the effective index of difficulty, and use throughput.py to measure the throughput. 

In our study, we used the throughput (TP) to compare the functionality and the effectiveness of various pointing devices.
